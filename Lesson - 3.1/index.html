<h1>Mark Zuckerberg</h1>
<P class="st">Early years
    Zuckerberg began using computers and writing software in middle school. His father taught him Atari BASIC
    Programming in the 1990s, and later hired software developer David Newman to tutor him privately. Zuckerberg took a
    graduate course in the subject at Mercy College near his home while still in high school. In one program, since his
    father's dental practice was operated from their home, he built a software program he called "ZuckNet" that allowed
    all the computers between the house and dental office to communicate with each other. It is considered a "primitive"
    version of AOL's Instant Messenger, which came out the following year.[19][20]

    A New Yorker profile said of Zuckerberg: "some kids played computer games. Mark created them." Zuckerberg himself
    recalls this period: "I had a bunch of friends who were artists. They'd come over, draw stuff, and I'd build a game
    out of it." The New Yorker piece noted that Zuckerberg was not, however, a typical "geek-klutz", as he later became
    captain of his prep school fencing team and earned a classics diploma. Napster co-founder Sean Parker, a close
    friend, notes that Zuckerberg was "really into Greek odysseys and all that stuff", recalling how he once quoted
    lines from the Roman epic poem Aeneid, by Virgil, during a Facebook product conference.[13]

    During Zuckerberg's high-school years, he worked under the company name Intelligent Media Group to build a music
    player called the Synapse Media Player. The device used machine learning to learn the user's listening habits, which
    was posted to Slashdot[21] and received a rating of 3 out of 5 from PC Magazine.[22]</P>
